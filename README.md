**Mojibake** is a low-level Unicode 17 library written in C11. It can be compiled as C++17 as well.

**Mojibake** (Japanese: 文字化け 'character transformation') is the garbled text that is the result
of text being decoded using an unintended character encoding. I created this library because I don't
like any of the existing one. It aims to be, in order of importance:

1. Small
2. Easy to use
3. Fast
4. Pass all Unicode Standard tests
5. Self-contained

It consists in a `mojibake.c` file, a `mojibake.h` file and a `mojibake.db` file (a SQLite database
file). A `shell.c` file is also provided that let you build a `mojibake` CLI, if you want. Also a
C++ wrapper can be found on `ext/cpp/mojibake.cpp` if you prefer it.

An online demo can be found at https://mojibake.zaerl.com/. It is a WASM-compiled version you can
use to preview the API.

This library works in little-endian systems to avoid adding too much overhead. This means that it
works in all modern general-purpose CPUs today (x86, x86-64, ARMv8, RISC-V, etc.)

It has been tested on:

1. MacOS
2. Alpine Linux
3. Windows 11

It has a `0.0.0` version because the various parts I consider critical have not 100% coverage. These
are the major parts:

**Normalization**: `mjb_normalize`, and other, let you normalize a string to `NFC/NFKC/NFD/NFKD` form.

**Full character properties**: `mjb_codepoint_character`, and other, let you obtain all the
properties found in the Unicode Character Database.

**Case**: `mjb_case`, and other, let you normalize a string to uppercase, lowercase,
titlecase. Etc.

**Parsing**: `mjb_next_character`, and other, let you parse a UTF-8, UTF-16(BE, LE), UTF-32(BE, LE)
string.

**Segmentation and line breaking**: `mjb_break_line`, and other, let you break a string by line, and
segment it.

**Base string functions**: `mjb_strncmp`, and other, aim to have a full coverage of standard C
library `string.h` header.

Following an incomplete documentation of current API.

## String normalization

Mojibake let you normalize a string in NFC/NFKC/NFD/NFKD form.

```c
#include "mojibake.h"

// The string to normalize
const char *hello = "Hello, World!"
mjb_result result;

char *normalized = mjb_normalize(hello, 13, MJB_ENCODING_UTF_8, MJB_NORMALIZATION_NFC, &result);
printf("Normalized: %s\nSize: %zu\n", result.output, result.output_size);

// Remember to free() the string
mjb_free(result.output);

```

## Codepoints informations

You can retrieved informations about codepoints. Example for `U+022A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS AND MACRON`

```c
#include "mojibake.h"

mjb_character character;
mjb_codepoint_character(0x022A, &character);

printf("U+%04X: %s\n", character.codepoint, character.name);
// See the `mojibake` struct for other fields
```

Output:

```
U+022A: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS AND MACRON
```

### CLI

A `shell.c` file is provided that let you have a CLI to test the library. Example usage:

```sh
mojibake -vv char $'\U022A'
# Similar to
# mojibake -vv codepoint 022A
```

Plain text output:

```

Hex UTF-16BE: 02 2A

JSON format:

```sh
mojibake -vv -o json char $'\U022A'
# Similar to
# mojibake -vv -o json codepoint 022A
```

Output:

JSON is by default indented with two characters. But you can change it, if you need to parse
multiple codepoints. E.g. `mojibake -j 0 -o json char $'\U61\U62'`

### Coverage

Mojibake run all the normalization tests found in the standard
[NormalizationTest.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/16.0.0/ucd/NormalizationTest.txt) suite of
tests.

## WebAssembly

An experimental WASM build can be used.

```
make wasm
cd build-wasm/src
python3 -m http.server # or similar
# Open http://[::1]:8000/wasm.html. It will show the Mojibake version on console
```

## Thanks

Mojibake is built using the work of extraordinary individuals and teams.
